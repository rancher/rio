# Rio [Alpha]

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/rancher/rio)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/rancher/rio)

Rio is a MicroPaaS that can be layered on top of any standard Kubernetes cluster. Consisting of a few Kubernetes custom resources and a CLI to enhance the user experience, users can easily deploy services to Kubernetes and automatically get continuous delivery, DNS, HTTPS, routing, monitoring, autoscaling, canary deployments, git-triggered builds, and much more. All it takes to get going is an existing Kubernetes cluster and the rio CLI.

Rio is currently in Alpha.

## Quick Start

1. Have a Kubernetes 1.13 or newer cluster running.

   [k3s](https://k3s.io/), [RKE](https://github.com/rancher/rke), [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/), [Docker For Mac Edge](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/edge-release-notes/), [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/), [AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/), [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/),

   Please ensure you have at least 3GB of memory free in your cluster. We will attempt to reduce the memory footprint in a future release. Some of the components we are currently depending on are quite large.

2. Run

```bash
# Download the CLI (available for macOS, Windows, Linux)
$ curl -sfL https://get.rio.io | sh -   # or manually from https://github.com/rancher/rio/releases

# Setup your cluster for Rio
$ rio install

# Make sure all the pods are up and running. These takes several minutes.
$ kubectl get po -n rio-system

# Run a sample service
$ rio run https://github.com/rancher/rio-demo

# Check the status
$ rio ps
$ rio console
$ rio info
```

Note: Rio will use a [service loadbalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) to expose the service mesh gateway.
If your cluster doesn't support service load balancers, simply run `rio install --mode hostport` to use host ports to expose gateway.

If your host has multiple IP addresses, you can specify which IP address Rio should use for creating external DNS records with the `--ip-address` flag. For instance to advertise the external IP of an AWS instance: `rio install --ip-address $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4)`

On start up, you can specify which feature to disable when installing rio. Simply run `rio install --disable-features autoscaling,build --disable-features letsencrypt`

| Feature | Description |
|----------|----------------|
| autoscaling | Auto-scaling services based on QPS and requests load
| build | Rio Build, from source code to deployment
| grafana | Grafana Dashboard
| istio | Service routing using Istio
| kiali | Kiali Dashboard
| letsencrypt | Let's Encrypt
| mixer | Istio Mixer telemetry
| prometheus | Enable prometheus
| rdns | Assign cluster a hostname from public Rancher DNS service
