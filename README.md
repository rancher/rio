Rio
===

## Rio is currently being massively overhauled. Expect to see something around May/June.

1. Simple, fun, end-to-end container experience
1. Cloud Native Container Distribution

Rio is a user oriented end-to-end container solution with a focus on keeping containers simple and
combating the current trend of complexity. It's kept fun and simple through it's familiar and
opinionated user experience.  Additionally, Rio is a "Cloud Native Container Distribution"
meaning it includes builtin Cloud Native technologies such as Kubernetes, Istio, Containerd, etc.
so that the user need not be an expert in installing, using, and maintaining these systems.

## Current Status: Early Preview

This is an early preview, features may be broken, not work as described, and has been known to be irresistibly drawn
to large cities, where it will back up sewers, reverse street signs, and steal everyone's left shoe.
Please try it out and file bugs.

### Goals

1. Fun. Containers should be fun.
1. Simple. Simple can only be achieved by applying some opinion and as such Rio is an opinionated tool.
1. Portable. Each Rio cluster should have the same functionality available to it.  The differences between clusters
are only speed, reliability, and permissions.  Running in production should be just as simple as your laptop (and vice versa)
1. Secure. Rio will by default use the best security settings and encryption and such will be enabled by default.
1. Product Grade. Running Rio should give you a production worthy system and not need you to bolt on infinite more ops tools.
1. Cloud Native Distribution.  Rio will include all the the key cloud native technologies by default such that each user does not
need to be an expert in the details.

## Quick Start

1. Have a Kubernetes cluster running. Rio can be running in any kubernetes cluster that supports ingress. (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/)
   For example, if you want to use [k3s](https://k3s.io/), run `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -`.
2. Download the latest Rio CLI release from the [release page](https://github.com/rancher/rio/releases), Linux, Mac and Windows binaries are provided.
3. Set up KUBECONFIG variable. `export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig`.
4. Run `rio install`. 

You should be able to see logs like this
```
Deploying Rio control plane....
Rio control plane is deployed. Run `kubectl -n rio-system describe deploy rio-controller` to get more detail.
Welcome to Rio!
```
Waiting for all the management pods to be up and running. `kubectl get po -n rio-system`

Done! Now try [an example](./README.md#rio-stage-options-service_id_name).

## Installation

Download: [Linux, Mac, Windows](https://github.com/rancher/rio/releases)

Run `rio install`.

Follow the onscreen prompts and Rio will try to install itself into the current `kubectl` cluster.  Please note `cluster-admin`
privileges are required for Rio.  This will probably changes, but for now we need the world.

All the prerequisite that Rio needs is just a KUBECONFIG file. Rio itself Contains the CLI and management plane controller 
which install CRD and start controller in the current cluster. By default if you install rio in your current cluster you will
automatically get a DNS record registered for your ingress IPs. If you run `rio info` you should be able to see the domain.

```
Â» rio info                                                                                   
Rio Version: dev
Cluster Domain: xxxxx.on-rio.io
System Namespace: rio-system
```

Using Rio
=========

## Concepts

### Service

The main unit that is being dealt with in Rio are services.  Services are just a collection of containers that provide a
similar function.  When you run containers in Rio you are really creating a Scalable Service.  `rio run` and `rio create` will
create a service.  You can later scale that service with `rio scale`.  Services are assigned a DNS name so that group
of containers can be accessed from other services.

### Apps

App contains multiple service revisions. Each service is rio can uniquely be identified as a revision, group by app and version.
App aggregates all the revisions by app name, provides an entry to access all the revisions. What percentage of traffic goes to which 
revision depends on how much weight is set on each revision.

### Service Mesh

Rio has a built in service mesh, powered by Istio and Envoy.  The service mesh provides all of the core communication
abilities for services to talk to each other, inbound traffic and outbound traffic.  All traffic can be encrypted,
validated, and routed dynamically according to the configuration.  Rio specifically does not require the user to
understand much about the underlying service mesh.  Just know that all communication is going through the service mesh.

### Router

Router is an abstract layer sitting on top of services, it provides a configuration to different services. It can define various 
routing rules to match different backends. Router also provides an entry to access and a Dns name in the cluster.

### ExternalService

ExternalService provides a way to create dns record for services that are outside of mesh. It can be IP addresses and FQDN.

## Basics

For each of these command you can run `rio --help` to get all the available options.

### rio run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

Run a scalable service with given options.  There's a lot of options, run `rio run --help`

### rio create [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

The same as run but create a service with scale=0.  To start the service afterwards
run `rio scale`

### rio ps [OPTIONS] [STACK...]

List the running services or containers.  By default `rio ps` will show services.  To
view the individual containers backing the service run `rio ps -c` or you can run
`rio ps myservice` to list the containers backing a specific service.

### rio scale [SERVICE=NUMBER...]

Scale a service up or down. You can pass as many services as you wish for example

    rio scale myservice=3 otherstack/myservice2=1

### rio rm [ID_OR_NAME...]

Delete a resource.  `rio rm` will delete most any resource by ID or name excepts nodes.
If the name matches multiple resources the CLI will ask you which specific one to delete.
You can use IDs and the `--type` option to narrow down to delete specific things and not use
fuzzy matching.

### rio inspect [ID_OR_NAME...]

Return the raw json API response of the object.  You can use `--format` to change
to yaml or format the output using go formatting.

## Rio Files

Services in Rio can be imported, exported and dynamically edited. The syntax of the rio files
is an extension of the docker-compose format.  We wish to be backwards compatible with
docker-compose where feasible.  This means Rio should be able to run a docker-compose file, but
a Rio stack file will not run in docker-compose as we are only backwards compatible.  

Rio files has three parts: Services, Config and raw Kubernetes manifest. Below is an example of more complex stack 
file that is used to deploy build compenents.

```yaml

```

### rio export SERVICE_NAME

Export a specific service.  This will print the service to standard out.  You can pipe the out
of the export command to a file using the shell, for example `rio export myservice > rio-stack.yml`

### rio apply -f FILE|-

Import a stack from file or standard in.

1. Create a rio file with the following content.

```yaml
services:
  demo:
    image: ibuildthecloud/demo:v1
    ports:
    - 80/http
```

2. Run the following scripts 
```bash
# Create stack foo from standard input
cat service.yml | rio apply -f -

# see if the service 
rio ps
```

Apply a remote url
```bash
$ rio apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrongMonkey/demo/master/demo-stack.yaml
INFO[0000] Deploying rio-file to namespace [default] from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrongMonkey/demo/master/demo-stack.yaml

```

### rio edit $NAME

Edit a specific service and run `rio up` with the new contents. Only works for services right now

### Questions

When running `up` stack files can prompt the user for questions.  To define a question add questions
to your stack file as follows

```yaml
services:
  foo:
    environment:
      VAR: ${BLAH}
    image: nginx
    
template:
  questions:
  - variable: BLAH
    description: "You should answer something good"
```

The values of the questions can be references anywhere in the stack file using
${..} syntax.  The following bash style variables are supported (using [github.com/drone/envsubst](http://github.com/drone/envsubst))

```
${var^}
${var^^}
${var,}
${var,,}
${var:position}
${var:position:length}
${var#substring}
${var##substring}
${var%substring}
${var%%substring}
${var/substring/replacement}
${var//substring/replacement}
${var/#substring/replacement}
${var/%substring/replacement}
${#var}
${var=default}
${var:=default}
${var:-default}
```

Questions have the following fields

| Name                | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| variable            | The variable name to reference using ${...} syntax |
| label               | A friend name for the question |
| description         | A longer description of the question |
| type                | The field type: string, int, bool, enum.  default is string |
| required            | The answer can not be blank |
| default             | Default value of the answer if not specified by the user |
| group               | Group the question with questions in the same group (Most used by UI) |
| min_length          | Minimum length of the answer |
| max_length          | Maximum length of the answer |
| min                 | Minimum value of an int answer |
| max                 | Maximum value of an int answer |
| options             | An array of valid answers for type enum questions |
| valid_chars         | Answer must be composed of only these characters |
| invalid_chars       | Answer must not have any of these characters |
| subquestions        | A list of questions that are considered child questions |
| show_if             | Ask question only if this evaluates to true, more info on syntax below |
| show_subquestion_if | Ask subquestions if this evaluates to true |

For `showIf` and `showSubquestionsIf` the syntax is `VARIABLE=VALUE [&& VARIABLE=VALUE]`.  For example

```
questions:
- variable: STORAGE
  description: Do you want to use persistent storage
  type: bool
- variable: STORAGE_TYPE
  type: enum
  options:
  - aws
  - local
- variable: SIZE
  description: Size of the volume to create
  show_if: STORAGE
- variable: AWS_KEY
  description: Enter AWS API key
  show_if: STORAGE && STORAGE_TYPE=aws
```

### Templating

All stack files are go templates so any go templating can be used.  Please remember that
heavy use of templating makes the stack files hard to read so use conservatively.  Also,
all stack files must render with all empty variable.

`Values` is put into the template context as a map of all variable values, for example `{{ if eq .Values.STORAGE "true" }}`.
Regardless of the type of the question, the `Values` map will always contain strings.

## Interacting with Services

### rio exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]

Launch a new command in a service or container

### rio attach [OPTIONS] CONTAINER

Attach to an existing running process in a service or container

### rio logs [OPTIONS] [CONTAINER_OR_SERVICE...]

Get or tail logs of a service or container

## Service Config Files

In a stack you can define the contents of files that can then be injected into containers. For example

```
configs:
  index:
    content: "<h1>hi</h1>"
    
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - 80/http
    configs:
    - index:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

```

Configs can be defined using a string or base64 format, using
either the contents or encoded keys for string or base64
respectively.

```
configs:
  index:
    # String format
    content: "<h1>hi</h1>"
  index2:
    # base64, for binary data
    encoded: PGgxPmhpPC9oMT4K
```

### rio cat [NAME...]

Echo to standard out the contents of the reference config

### rio config ls

List all configs

### rio config create NAME FILE|-

Create a config of the given NAME from FILE or from standard input if `-` is passed.

### rio config update NAME FILE|-

Update a config of the given NAME from FILE or from standard input if `-` is passed.

### rio edit

The standard `rio edit` command can edit configs also

## Cluster Domain and TLS

By default Rio will create a DNS record pointing to your ingress IPs. Rio also uses Letsencrypt to create
a wildcard certificate for the cluster domain so that all the traffic to access your application can be encrypted.
For example, When you deploy your workload, you can access your workload in HTTPS. The domain always follow the format
of ${app}-${namespace}.${cluster-domain}. You can see your cluster domain by running `rio info`.


```bash
# See cluster info
$ rio info
Rio Version: dev
Cluster Domain: 8axlxl.on-rio.io
System Namespace: rio-system

# Run your workload
$ rio run -p 80/http --name svc --scale=3 ibuildthecloud/demo:v1

# See the endpoint of your workload 
$ rio ps
NAME          ENDPOINT                               SCALE     WEIGHT
default/svc   https://svc-default.8axlxl.on-rio.io   v0/3      v0/100%

### Access your workload
$ curl https://svc-default.8axlxl.on-rio.io
Hello World
```

## Service Mesh

### Staging Versions

Service mesh will route traffic to given services.  Services can have multiple versions of
the service deployed at once and then the you can control how much traffic, or which traffic
is routed to each version.

### rio stage [OPTIONS] SERVICE_ID_NAME

The `rio stage` command takes all the same options as `rio create` but instead of updating
the existing service, it will stage a new version of the service.  For example, below is
scenario to do a canary deployment.

```bash

# Create a new service
$ rio run -p 80/http --name svc --scale=3 ibuildthecloud/demo:v1

# Ensure service is running and determine public URL
$ rio revision default/svc

## Autoscaling

By default rio will enable autoscaling for workloads. Depends on Qps and Current active requests on your workload,
Rio will scale the workload to the proper scale.

```bash
# Run a workload, set minimal scale and maximum scale
$ rio run -p 8080/http --name autoscale --scale=1-20 strongmonkey1992/autoscale:v0 
default/autoscale

# Put some load to the workload. We use tool [hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) to put loads.

## Source code to Deployment

Rio supports configure a git-based source code repository to deploy the actual workload. It can be as easy
as giving Rio a valid git repository repo. 

```bash
# Run a workload from a git repo. We assume the repo has a Dockerfile at root directory to build the image
$ rio run -p 8080/http -n build https://github.com/StrongMonkey/demo.git
default/build

# Waiting for the image to be built. Note the image column is empty. Once the image is ready service will be active
$ rio revision

When you point your workload to a git repo, Rio will automatically watch any commit or tag pushed to
a specific branch(default is master). By default Rio will pull and check the branch at a certain interval, but this
can be configured to use a webhook.

```bash
# edit the code, change v1 to v3, push the code
$ vim main.go | git add -u | git commit -m "change to v3" | git push $remote

# A new revision has been automatically created. Noticed that once the new revision is created, the traffic will
# automatically shifted from old revision to new revision.
$ rio revision default/build

## Monitoring

By default Rio will deploy [grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [kiali](https://www.kiali.io/) to give user abilities to watch all metrics corresponding to service mesh.

```bash
