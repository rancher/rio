ADDED:
       - Revocation now checks OCSP status.
       - Authenticated endpoints are now supported using HMAC tags.
       - Bundle can verify certificates against a domain or IP.
       - OCSP subcommand has been added.
       - PKCS #11 keys are now supported; this support is now the default.
       - OCSP serving is now implemented.
       - The multirootca tool is now available for multiple signing
         keys via an authenticated API.
       - A scan utility for checking the quality of a server's TLS
         configuration.
       - The certificate bundler now supports PKCS #7 and PKCS #12.
       - An info endpoint has been added to retrieve the signers'
         certificates.
       - Signers can now use a serial sequence number for certificate
         serial numbers; the default remains randomised serial numbers.
       - CSR whitelisting allows the signer to explicitly distrust
         certain fields in a CSR.
       - Signing profiles can include certificate policies and their
         qualifiers.
       - The multirootca can use Red October-secured private keys.
       - The multirootca can whitelist CSRs per-signer based on an
         IP network whitelist.
       - The signer can whitelist SANs and common names via a regular-
         expression whitelist.
       - Multiple fallback remote signers are now supported in the
         cfssl server.
       - A Docker build script has been provided to facilitate building
         CFSSL for all supported platforms.
       - The log package includes a new logging level, fatal, that
         immediately exits with error after printing the log message.

CHANGED:
       - CLI tool can read from standard input.
       - The -f flag has been renamed to -config.
       - Signers have been refactored into local and remote signers
         under a single universal signer abstraction.
       - The CLI subcommands have been refactored into separate
         packages.
       - Signing can now extract subject information from a CSR.
       - Various improvements to the certificate ubiquity scoring,
         such as accounting for SHA1 deprecation.
       - The bundle CLI tool can set the intermediates directory that
         newly found intermediates can be stored in.
       - The CLI tools return exit code 1 on failure.
