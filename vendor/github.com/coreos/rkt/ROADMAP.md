# rkt roadmap

This document defines a high level roadmap for rkt development.
The dates below should not be considered authoritative, but rather indicative of the projected timeline of the project.
The [milestones defined in GitHub](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/milestones) represent the most up-to-date state of affairs.

rkt's version 1.0 release marks the command line user interface and on-disk data structures as stable and reliable for external development.

## Ongoing projects

- [Kubernetes CRI](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/projects/1): adapting rkt to offer first-class implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface.
- [OCI native support](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/projects/4): supporting OCI specs natively in rkt.
- [appc phase-out](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/projects/5): following OCI evolution and stabilization, appc will be naturally deprecated and phased-out.

### Upcoming

Future tasks without a specific timeline are tracked at https://github.com/coreos/rkt/milestone/30.
