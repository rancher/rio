# Istio APIs and Common Configuration Definitions

This repository defines component-level APIs and common configuration formats for the Istio
platform. These definitions are specified using the [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf)
syntax.

This repository depends only on the [tools](https://github.com/istio/tools) repository for tools used during build. This repository *will not* depend on any other repositories. Except for tools, all other Istio repositories can take a dependency on the api repository. 

## API Guidelines

When making changes to the protos in this repository, your changes **must** comply with the [API guidelines](./GUIDELINES.md).

## Updating

After the [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) definitions
are updated, the corresponding `*pb.go` and `_pb2.py` files must be
generated by running `scripts/generate-protos.sh` and submitted as
part of the same PR as the updated definitions. Also `make
proto-commit` must be run to update the proto.lock file with new
changes.


If releasing a new tagged version, please update python/istio-api/setup.py version to reflect.
